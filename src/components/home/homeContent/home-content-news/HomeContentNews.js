                    <p className="Avenir-light">PROTECT WPS was an all-Filipino scientific expedition launched on April 22 with goal of exploring and conducting “biological and oceanographic research activities within Kalayaan Island Group-West Philippine Sea (KIG-WPS),” Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)’s Agos ng Buhay said.</p>
                    <p className="Avenir-light">DENR Agos added that the expedition aimed to generate baseline data in order to further understand the changes occurring in the country’s marine ecosystems.</p>
